# Waze_Customer_Churn

Use Case Overview: Waze User Churn Prediction
1. Business Goal & Objectives
Goal: To increase the overall growth of Waze by preventing monthly user churn on the Waze application

Objectives:

Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.
Analyze and interpret data, generate actionable insights, and help leadership make informed business decisions.
Empower the Waze leadership to make data-driven decision making by offering key insights and data-informed recommendations.
Proactively identify factors that will engage high-risk churn users to retain them.

Business Rules:

- Churn is the business term that describes how many customers stop using a product or service, or stop doing business with a company altogether and at what rate this occurs.
- User churn is measured by the number of users who have either uninstalled the app or stopped using the app.

Summary:

If Waze can identify a segment of users who are at high risk of churning, Waze can proactively engage these users with special offers to try and retain them. Otherwise, Waze may lose these users without knowing why.
 nsights will help Waze leadership optimize the company’s retention strategy, enhance user experience, and make data-driven decisions about product development.

Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as:

- WHO are the users most likely to churn?
- WHY do users churn?
- WHEN do users churn?

2. ML/Data Science Goal & Objectives
Goal: To develop machine learning models that predict user churn on the Waze application

Objectives:

- Identify missing values, duplicated data, and outliers and process them
Visualize data by creating bar chart, histogram, and box plots
- Determine the correct modeling approach

Transform data via:
- Imputation (e.g. reassign outlier values with median, encode character values to numerical values
- Feature Engineering techniques to prepare data for model building
- Feature selection
- Feature transformation
- Feature extraction

Improve model performance

- Via Hyperparameter-Tuning
- Use Grid Search to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters
- Build models that predict Waze user churn

Regression Techniques

- M1: Binomial Regression Model
Check model assumptions before and after building the model
Hypothesis Testing
- M2: Naive Bayes Model
- Tree-Based Models
- M3: Random Forest
- M4: Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
